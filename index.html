       <p>Hello my name is Belen, in this page you will find my previous projects and get to know more about my me. 
        
        Before I started my journey into the tech world, I was lost on what I wanted to accomplish i both my professional and personal life. I took a year off school and started working while researching what really intrigues. After a year I decided to dive into the Business and Tech.
        I want to be able to move along with the advances of technology and see how those are changing and improving how we run business now. I also want to broadcast my skills on a much bigger platform with a bigger voice that I could never imagine I would have.</p>
           
      <p>Please follow me on my journey to showing the world the tech skill I am acquring through my time at Year-up. </p>
